# ML-ALGORITHM
implement different algorithms using core python.

## KEY IDEA
```
A support vector machine (SVM) is a type of deep learning algorithm that performs supervised learning for classification or regression of data groups. ... The algorithms draw lines (hyperplanes) to separate the groups according to patterns. An SVM builds a learning model that assigns new examples to one group or another.
